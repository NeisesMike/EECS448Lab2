		<caption>Programming Paradigms</caption>
		<th>Paradigm</th>
		<th>Parent Paradigm</th>
		<th>Paradigm Description</th>
		<tr>
			<td>Imperative</td>
			<td></td> 
			<td>Use statements to change a program's state. Describe how a program operates.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Declarative</td>
			<td></td> 
			<td>Describe what a program should do. Lacks side-effects.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Object Oriented</td>
			<td>Imperative</td> 
			<td>Focus on data structures called "objects," and procedures called "methods."</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Structured</td>
			<td>Imperative/Declarative</td> 
			<td>Takes advantages of things like "for" and "while" loops to organize the flow and clarity of code.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Logic</td>
			<td>Declarative</td> 
			<td>Code consists of logical assertions that are used to answer questions given in a declarative format.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Procedural</td>
			<td>Imperative/Structured</td> 
			<td>Hinges on the idea of "procedures," which are like functions or methods, but are accessible everywhere.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Functional</td>
			<td>Declarative/Structured</td> 
			<td>Treats computation as mathematical functions. Avoids changing state, so that all functions are injective.</td>
		</tr>
