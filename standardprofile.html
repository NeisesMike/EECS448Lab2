					<p> If you don't already know who he is, you'll want to steer clear of Mr. Standard, Chummer. I suggest you log off the matrix right now. But on the off-chance you already know him, most of this info will be redundant for you. Mr. Standard is your fixer. That means he gets you jobs, numbskull. And you're one of his runners- Shadowrunners to be precise. As a Shadowrunner, you accept the dark and dank jobs of dubious legality. You steal, smuggle, sabatoge, protect, and kill. You do anything for that next meal. Mr. Standard is your connection to the higher ups. He doesn't like you, and you probably don't like him, but you rely on eachother for your paydirt. Mr. Standard operates as the medium between you and the Johnsons, and those are guys you never want to meet. They work for the megacorps, and they're as likely to kill you as they are to ask you to kill for them. So next time Mr. Standard gets short with you, remember this: he puts his ass on the line for both of you. </p>
